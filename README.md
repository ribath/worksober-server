# worksober-server
1. This server will run on 8000 port. If you have anything else running of that port you need to stop that service first. 
2. You need to have mongoDB installed locally in you machine to run this server. It connects at default mongoDB port 27017 for database access. 
3. I would've added a login and api authentication system if I had more time.
4. Input validation could've been done in much better fashion.
5. To demostrate a good use of redux there is no local state in the front end. All state is handeled inside redux. 
6. Network calls are also handeled inside thunks to demostrate the use of asynchronous action in redux.
